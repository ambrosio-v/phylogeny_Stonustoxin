## UC LEADS symposium February 2025

Hopefully this is the last place I am writing code. Keep it clean

## Load libraries

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
